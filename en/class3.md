# Python3 introduction - First lecture: Print

> Welcome, dear Python developer!

After the study of the first few classes, we have done all the preparatory work. Next, we can learn the first code in Python,```print```

We first create a new text document on the desktop, change the suffix of the file to. Py, and then open it with Notepad++.   
Please select the character encoding correctly. Wrong setting may lead to garbled code in actual use.   
Check the coding display in the lower right corner and the instructions in the coding menu.   
If "UTF-8" is not displayed (such as displaying other character codes such as GB2312), click "encoding" - > "convert to UTF-8 encoding" to convert the character encoding of the file to "UTF-8", and then save it.   
This is an international coding standard, which can avoid the problem of font garbled in different language systems.

For most programming languages, the first entry-level programming code is "Hello world! ", the following code is to output Hello world using Python!   
```print("Hello, World!")```

It can be seen that if you want the computer to output characters, the format in Python is like this```Print ("add content here")```   
Is it easy?

Put the above code into the. Py file and double-click after saving. Did you find that the window flickered for a moment and then disappeared, and you couldn't see the content at all? Just add two lines of code.   
This line of code is placed on the line above the line of print   
```import os```

This line of code is under the line of print   
``` os.system ("pause")```

Save and run again, won't it flash?
That's all for today's class. See you next week!

Note: all Python symbols must be in English
