# Python3's introduction

> Welcome, dear Python developer!

If you want to start over from where you last ended, you can select the chapter from the left.

First of all, welcome to read the tutorial document I wrote!  
This tutorial will take you to the development of Python for a simple understanding, briefly explain the development of simple essentials and precautions.  
I hope you can feel a piece of cake after reading this content, or you can face the difficulties.

Line development requires:
> A computer. At the same time, please make sure you have more time to use.

> English level. Memorizing command names can be very helpful.

> Humility. Every one of us is only a little bit superficial, always remain modest.

> Patience. Python development knowledge is not only large, but also very systematic. Behind the achievement is to pay. If you can't accept it, please give up the dream of Python development.

We began to study the preparation of development environment. Please select [preparation â†’ development environment preparation] from the left menu bar.
