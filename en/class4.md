# Python3 introduction - lecture 2: input

> welcome, dear python developer! 

After the study of last class, we have learned the instruction ```print```.    
Next, we can learn the second code in our Python, ```input```   
We first create a new text document on the desktop, change the suffix of the file to.py, and then open it with Notepad++.   
Please select the character encoding correctly. Wrong setting may lead to garbled code in actual use.   
Check the coding display in the lower right corner and the instructions in the coding menu.   
If "UTF-8" is not displayed (such as displaying other character codes such as GB2312), click "encoding" - > "convert to UTF-8 encoding" to convert the character encoding of the file to "UTF-8", and then save it.   
This is an international coding standard, which can avoid the problem of font garbled in different language systems.(Same as last time) 

As we know, in the composition, there are hints before writing the content of speech, similarly, in the ```input```code, there are hints. 
You can run the following code into a file to see it. 
```input("How are you?") ```
As you can see, to enter a character in Python, the format is```input("add content here")``` Isn't that easy? 

Put the above code into the.py file, save and double-click. 
After typing and entering, did you notice that the window was gone? 
Just add two lines of code like we did last time. 
```import os```   
```os.system("pause")``` 

That's all for today's class. 

see you next week!   
Note: Next time we will teach variables.
